LINEAR PREDICTION CEPSTRAL COEFFICIENTS (LPCC) FEATURE FOR KADAZANDUSUN SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH NEURAL NETWORK

This is my Final Year Project.

Project Objective
1. To investigate the Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficient feature
extraction for Kadazandusun speech data.
2. To recognize the Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficient speech feature
using a neural network.
3. To evaluate the Kadazandusun speech recognition based on Linear
Predictive Cepstral Coefficient features and Neural Network.
